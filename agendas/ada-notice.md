The Department of Neighborhood Empowerment requires
that all neighborhood council agendas
include language
informing the public
of their rights
under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

To assure compliance
with their regulations,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment
will not publish
an agenda
that does not
include this information.

Example ADA notice:
