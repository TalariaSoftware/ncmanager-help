The Department of Neighborhood Empowerment requires
that all neighborhood council agendas
include language
informing the public
of their rights
under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

<aside class="callout" role="complementary" markdown="1">
In NCMS,
add the ADA notice
as an [agenda postscript](/ncms/agenda-postscripts)
so that
it is included
in all
of the agendas.
</aside>

To assure compliance
with their regulations,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment
will not publish
an agenda
that does not
include this information.

Example ADA notice:

> **The Americans with Disabilities Act**
>
> As a covered entity under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
> the City of Los Angeles does not discriminate on the basis of disability
> and, upon request, will provide reasonable accommodation to ensure equal
> access to its programs, services, and activities. Sign language interpreters,
> assistive listening devices, and other auxiliary aids and/or services may be
> provided upon request. To ensure availability of services, please make your
> request at least 3 business days (72 hours) prior to the meeting you wish to
