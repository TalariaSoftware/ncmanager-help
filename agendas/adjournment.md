Every meeting ends eventually,
even if
it doesn't seem
like it will.

Adjourning a meeting
is an official action
of the board or committee.
Therefore, like everything else
the assembly does,
it should be listed
as an item
on the agenda.

Because it is
the last thing
that happens
at a neighborhood council meeting,
it should be
the last item
on the meeting agenda.

Example agenda item:

> 12. Adjournment
