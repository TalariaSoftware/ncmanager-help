Agenda items are the things
that the board or committee
may actually discuss
and take action on.
In order to comply
with the Brown Act
an NC board or committee
can only discuss or act
on things
that are on the agenda
for that meeting.

An agenda item should include
a title for easy reference,
and a brief description
of the item
if necessary.

The description should have
enough informaion
for the public to know
what is going
to be discussed,
but should not
try to incorporate
all of the details.

The description should be
as short
as possible.
Long descriptions
actually hide
key information.
The Brown Act states that
a "brief general description
of an item
generally need not
exceed 20 words."[^549542]

Because
[call to order,](/agendas/call-to-order)
taking roll,
[general public comment,](/agendas/general-public-comment)
[approval of the minutes,](/agendas/approval-of-minutes)
and [adjournment](/agendas/adjournment)
happen at every meeting,
they should be
on the agenda
at every meeting.
