Agenda items are the things
that the board or committee
may discuss
or take action on.
In order to comply
with the Brown Act,
a neighborhood council board or committee
can only discuss or act
on things
that are on the agenda
for that meeting.

An agenda item should have
a title for easy reference.
If necessary,
it should
also include
a brief description
of the item.

The agenda item should contain
enough information
for the public to know
what is going
to be discussed,
but it should not
try to incorporate
all of the details.

The description,
if included,
should be
as short
as possible.
Long descriptions
obscure key information.
The Brown Act states that
a "brief general description
of an item
generally need not
exceed 20 words."[^549542]

Because
[call to order,](/agendas/call-to-order)
[taking roll,](/agendas/roll-call)
[general public comment,](/agendas/general-public-comment)
[approval of the minutes,](/agendas/approval-of-minutes)
and [adjournment](/agendas/adjournment)
happen at every meeting,
they should be
listed as items
on the agenda
of every meeting.
