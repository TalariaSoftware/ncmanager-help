With NCMS,
the call to order
can be one
of the [default agenda items](/ncms/default-agenda-items)
automatically added to
every agenda.
</aside>

The call to order is
the first thing
that happens
at a Neighborhood Council meeting.
When the presiding officer
announces that the meeting
has started,
that is the call to order.[^ronr315]

Because it is
the first thing
that happens
at a neighborhood council meeting,
it should be
the first item
on the meeting agenda.

Example agenda item:

> 1. Call to Order

[^ronr315]:
    Robert's Rules of Order describes
    the call to order
    in detail.
