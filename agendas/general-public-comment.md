The Brown Act requires that
every agenda include
an opportunity
for members
of the public
to directly address the committee
on any item
of interest
to the public
that is within
the board's jurisdiction.[^549543]

To ensure compliance
with the law,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE)
will not publish
an agenda
that doesn't
include this item.
