title: Agendas

An agenda
lets everyone know
what is going
to be discussed
in the meeting.
It helps people decide
if they should attend
and also helps them
be prepared
for the meeting
when they do attend.

The Brown Act requires
that every topic
that is going
to be discussed
appear on the agenda
and that nothing is discussed
that is not
on the agenda.
This ensures that
everyone can be
aware of
and participate in
the deliberations
of government.

This guide is designed
to give you
everything you need
to create agendas
that are complete,
easy to understand,
and compliant
will all applicable laws and regulations.
