The first thing you need
on your agenda
is a description
of who, what, when, and where.

An agenda needs
to have
the name
of the assembly
that is meeting.
For neighborhood councils,
that is going to be
a committee
of the neighborhood council
or the governing board.

The agenda should indicate
if the meeting
is a regular meeting
or special meeting.

The agenda also needs
to say
when and where
the meeting
is being held
so that people
are able
to attend.
On your agendas,
list the date
of the meeting
(with the year)
and the scheduled start time.

If your meeting
is being held
in person,
include the full address
in the agenda.
If your meeting
is being held online,
include
everything people need
to be able
to attend.
