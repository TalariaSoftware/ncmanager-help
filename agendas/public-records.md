The Department of Neighborhood Empowerment requires
that all neighborhood council agendas
include language
informing the public
of their right
to access government records
as ensured
by the California Public Records Act (CPRA).

<aside class="callout" role="complementary" markdown="1">
In [NCMS,](/ncms)
add the CPRA notice
as an [agenda postscript](/ncms/agenda-postscripts)
so that
it is included
in all
of the agendas.
</aside>

To assure compliance
with their regulations,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment
will not publish
an agenda that does not
include this information.

Example CPRA notice:

> **Public Access to Records**
> 
> In compliance with Government Code section 54957.5, non-exempt writings
> that are distributed to a majority or all of the board in advance of a
> meeting may be viewed at 123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA 90000, at our
> website: www.example.org or at the scheduled meeting. In addition, if you
> would like a copy of any record related to an item on the agenda, please
> contact J. Davenport, Board President, at (323) 555-5555 or email
> chair@example.org.
