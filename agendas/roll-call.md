After the call to order
but before
any other meeting business,
a neighborhood council board or committee
should take roll
of the members.
The roll call establishes
for the record
what members were present
for the meeting
and if there is
a quorum present.

Because it is
the second thing
that happens
at a neighborhood council meeting,
it should be
the second item
on the meeting agenda.

Example agenda item:

    2. Roll Call
