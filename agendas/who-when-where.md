The first thing you need
on your agenda
is a description
of who is meeting, when, and where.
Be sure to include enough detail
so that anyone
who wants to
can join.

Example:

      Hill Valley Neighborhood Council Party Committee
      October 21, 2015 4:30
      Courthouse Mall Community Room
      100 Courthouse Square
      Hill Valley, CA 90000

If your meeting is being held virtually,
then the agenda needs
to include
all the information
people need
to be able
to attend.

Example:

      Hill Valley Neighborhood Council Board
      October 21, 2015 4:30
      Teleconference meeting
