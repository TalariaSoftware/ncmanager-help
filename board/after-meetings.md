Once you have
had your board meeting,
the hard work is done.
But there are still
some things to do
to make your committee effective
as well as compliant
with relevant laws and regulations.

After your committee meeting,
you need to
[publish the meeting minutes](publish-minutes),
[publish updated and approved minutes](publish-approved-minutes),
and fill out
[Board Action Certification forms](board-action-certification).
