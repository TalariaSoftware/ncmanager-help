title: Board Action Certification
permalink: /:path/:basename
---

The board
of the neighborhood council
exercises all
of the governmental authority
of the neighborhood council.
That includes the financial authority
to spend neighborhood council funds.
For the City Clerk
to direct those funds,
according to the board's decisions,
they need documentation indicating what
the board's decision was.
This is known
as the Board Action Certification form,
or BAC for short.

A BAC can be requested
by any city department
as proof
of a neighborhood council board action,
but most often
it is required
by the City Clerk's office
for actions
regarding neighborhood council finances.

The City Clerk requires a BAC
in order to:

- approve monthly expenditure reports,[^mer]
- send check payments to vendors,[^checkpayment]
- fund neighborhood purpose grants,[^npg]
- fund community improvement projects,[^cip]
- get access to the Neighborhood Council Funding System[^fundingaccess],
- update the budget[^budget],
- approve leases,[^lease]
- approve contracts,[^contract],
- sponsor or co-sponsor an event,[^events]
- increase bank card limits,[^cardlimit]
- submit a Missing Receipt Affidavit[^missingreciept], or
- ratify emergency spending[^emergency].

## Filling out a BAC

A board action certification must include:

- the name of the neighborhood council,
- the date the action was taken,
- the budget fiscal year,
- and the action taken,
  which is either
  a board motion
  or the public benefit statement
  for a community improvement project
  or a neighborhood purpose grant.

 The BAC must have
 a list
 of all the board members
 with their position
 and their vote,
 as well as
 the total votes
 and the board quorum.

 Finally,
 the BAC must be signed and dated.
 For financial items,
 the BAC must be signed
 by two people authorized
 to handle financial transactions
 for the NC.

<!-- We, the authorized signers of the above named Neighborhood Council, declare that the information presented on this form is accurate and complete, and that a public meeting was held in accordance with all laws, policies, and procedures. The above was approved by the Neighborhood Council Board, at a Brown Act compliant public meeting where a quorum of the Board was present. -->
