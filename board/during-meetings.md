You scheduled a meeting,
created,
and then published the agenda.
Now it's time
to do the real work.
It's time to
get together, discuss, and take actions
on the important issues.
It's time
to have a board meeting.

During your board meeting
you need someone
to [preside over the meeting](preside)
and you need someone
to [take minutes](take-minutes).
