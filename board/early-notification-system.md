The Early Notification System (ENS) exists
so the city
can distribute information
about the City Council
as well as
other commissions, committees, departments, and boards,
including neighborhood council boards.
Interested members
of the public
can sign up
and receive
agendas for city meetings
by email.

<aside class="callout" role="complementary" markdown="1">
NCMS makes
it is easy
to [create PDF agendas](/ncms/agenda-pdfs)
to send to ENS.
</aside>

ENS is a valuable tool
for the public
to stay aware
of what is happening
in city government.
It was prescribed
in the same part
of the City Charter
that created Neighborhood Councils.[^laccsec907]
It was further defined
in the Plan for Neighborhood Councils.[^planart8]

Finally,
BONC policy requires
all neighborhood council committees
submit a copy
of all agendas
to to be posted
through ENS.[^bonc2014011]

To submit
your board agenda
to be posted
to ENS,
email it
as a PDF file
to [ncsupport@lacity.org](mailto:ncsupport@lacity.org?subject=Agenda for [[[NC BOARD OR COMMITTEE]]] meeting on [[[DATE]]])
with the date and title
of the meeting
as the email subject.
