The officers
of the board are board members
chosen by the board
to perform
specific duties
necessary to having
a well-functioning
neighborhood council.

The specific officers
for an NC board
are listed in article VI
of the NC bylaws.

While all
of the officers
are important,
the minimum officers essential
for conducting business are
the presiding officer,
usually called president or chairperson,
and the secretary.

Officers are chosen
by a majority vote
of the board.[^choosing]
Unlike other elections,
it is not sufficient
to receive more votes
than anyone else.
If no one receives
more than half
of the votes cast
then no one is elected.
The board would need
to deliberate
and then vote again.

    This is specified

    in article VI, section 3.
