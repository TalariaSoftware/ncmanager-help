Not everyone
in your neighborhood
has easy access
to the web
or knows to check
your neighborhood council website.
It is important to post
your board agendas
in a public location,
so that everyone
can remain informed
about upcoming meetings.

NCMS makes
it is easy
to [create PDF agendas](/ncms/agenda-pdfs)
for printing and posting.

BONC policy requires
physically posting an agenda
for all NC board meetings.[^bonc2014011]
In addition,
the NC must notify DONE
of the location
of these postings.[^postinglocation]

Find out this location
for your Neighborhood Council,
and post your agenda there
at least 72 hours
before a regular meeting
and 24 hours
before a special meeting.
