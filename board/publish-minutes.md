title: Publish the Minutes
permalink: /:path/:basename

Your neighborhood council board
is a government body
and the minutes are
the record of what
that government body
has done.
You should publish
your board minutes
right away
to make them available
to the general public.

Publishing your minutes right away
also allows board members
to review them
while the meeting is fresh
in their mind.
This is helpful
when it comes time
to approve the minutes
at the next meeting.

You should publish
the board minutes
on the web
so everyone
who is interested
can find them.

I also recommend
emailing a copy
of the minutes
to the board members
so they are prompted
to review them right away.

Finally,
if you have a mailing list
of people
who are interested
in your NC
you may want
to email the minutes
to that list also.
