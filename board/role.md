The board is
the decision-making body[^governingbody]
of the neighborhood council.
It wields
all of the statutory power
of the neighborhood council.
That includes the power
to allocate funds
and to speak
on behalf
of the neighborhood council.

[^governingbody]:
    This is specified
    in Article V
    of your Neighborhood Council bylaws.
    For example:
    "The Board shall be
    the Governing Body
    of the Council
    within the meaning
    of that term
    as set forth in
    the [Plan
    for a Citywide System
    of Neighborhood Councils](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Plan_Amended_12-18-131.pdf)."
