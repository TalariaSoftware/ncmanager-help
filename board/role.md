The board is
the decision-making body[^governingbody]
of the neighborhood council.
All of the statutory power
of the neighborhood council
can only be exercised
by the board.
That includes the power
to allocate funds
and to speak
on behalf
of the neighborhood council.

[^governingbody]:
    This is specified
    in Article V
    of your Neighborhood Council bylaws.
    For example:
    "The Board shall be
    the Governing Body
    of the Council
    within the meaning
    of that term
    as set forth in
    the [Plan
    for a Citywide System
    of Neighborhood Councils](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Plan_Amended_12-18-131.pdf)."
