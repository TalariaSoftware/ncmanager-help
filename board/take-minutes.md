Take a look
at the [Minutes Guide](/minutes)
for information
about taking minutes
at a neighborhood council meeting.
</aside>

Once you are
in a meeting,
it is the responsibility
of the secretary
or their designee
to take minutes
of the meeting.[^bylawssecretaryminutes]

Minutes are the record
of the board meeting.
They should say
when and where the board met,
which board members were present,
and what actions the board took.

[^bylawssecretaryminutes]:
    This will usually
    be specified
    in article VI, section 2
    under the duties
    of the secretary.
    If not otherwise specified
    by the bylaws,
    parliamentary procedure
    gives this duty
    to the secretary.
