Once you are
in a meeting,
it is the responsibility
of the secretary
or their designee
to take minutes
of the meeting.[^bylawssecretaryminutes]

Minutes are the record
of the board meeting.
They should say
when and where the board met,
what board members were present,
and what actions were taken
by the board.

Take a look
at the [Minutes Guide](/minutes)
for information
about taking minutes
at a neighborhood council meeting.

[^bylawssecretaryminutes]:
    This will usually
    be specified
    in article VI, section 2
    under the duties
    of the secretary.
    If not, otherwise specified
    by the bylaws,
    parliamentary procedure
    gives this duty
    to the secretary.
