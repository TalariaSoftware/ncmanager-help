            <p>Congratulations again chairperson,</p>
            <p>This is a bunch of a advice I have about being the chair of the HSDNC. I think it’s great advice, but it is just advise so take it or leave it as you will.</p>
            <p>First, regarding Robert’s Rules of Order:</p>
            <p>I have not found a good resource for learning the basics. There are a lot of them on the Internet. Some are passable. I actually spent a lot of time reading (and rereading) large portions of the 1915(ish) edition. After a couple of years of presiding over this board I finally purchased a recent edition.</p>
            <p>What the online tutorials don’t tell you is that the presiding officer has an extraordinary amount of leeway for as long as the body permits it.</p>
            <p>For instance, for routine business as chair I simply assumed the motion. David will ask you, “Who made the motion? Who seconded it?” My response, “The chair assumed the motion.”</p>
            <p>For example, approving the minutes is something the board must do. And something they should do at every meeting. We could wait for someone to make the motion, massage it to a well-formed motion, and then wait to get a second. Or we can just assume the motion and get on with it.</p>
            <p>I did that for minutes and MERs (Monthly Expenditure Reports) both.</p>
            <p>Another trick, is to simply ask if there are objections. This is especially useful for adjourning.</p>
            <p>“Is there any objection to adjourn?” (Pause) “Hearing none, we are adjourned.”</p>
            <p>But I might be getting a little ahead of myself. I’m going to talk a tiny bit about the principles of parliamentary procedure. Please forgive me if I say things you already know.</p>
            <p>The goal is to identify the will of the majority, while at the same time protecting the rights of the minority to be heard.</p>
            <p>The basic structure is that there is a motion on the floor, i.e. a specific item to discuss. For example, “The HSDNC supports the proposed housing development at 6061 Sunset Blvd.” Or “The HSDNC approves funding of $200 to purchase business cards for board members.”</p>
            <p>Also note, that if there isn’t a motion on the floor there is nothing to discuss. Under Robert’s Rules, speakers need to stay on topic, and the topic is whatever motion is on the floor.</p>
            <p>This is incredibly valuable in creating a bias towards action. If we aren’t talking about doing something, there is nothing to talk about.</p>
            <p>But this is also something the board resists strongly. People want to blather on before proposing a course of action. It wastes a lot of time, but there isn’t much I could do about it.</p>
            <p>The best-known method to get a motion on the floor is to have a board member make the motion and have another board member second it.</p>
            <p>I.e.:</p>
            <p>“I move that the HSDNC appoint Damien Burke Dictator-for-Life.”</p>
            <p>“I second that motion.”</p>
            <p>But there are other ways to get a motion on the floor.</p>
            <p>I’ve already talked about assuming the motion — super useful for uncontroversial items.</p>
            <p>I will always assume a motion if a committee has recommended it. That’s in RoR somewhere. The idea is that if the committee recommended it, it’s at least proven that it’s worth discussing.</p>
            <p>This is my favorite way to get motions on the floor, because these are at least motions that someone has given a moment’s thought too. Unfortunately, our committees have not been functioning well recently so we didn’t have a lot of these.</p>
            <p>Motions made in the moment will often be ill-formed. Part of the job of the chair is to help formulate the motion into something sensible.</p>
            <p>“I move that we say yes.”</p>
            <p>“The chair hears a motion that the HSDNC approve the Neighborhood Purpose Grant application for $5,000 for Showers of Hope. Is that correct?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“The motion is to approve the Neighborhood Purpose Grant application for $5,000 for Showers of Hope. Is there a second?”</p>
            <p>Once a motion is on the floor board members can speak in favor of it or in opposition of it, or make a motion to amend it, or make a motion to vote on it, aka. “calling the question”.</p>
            <p>I.e.</p>
            <p>“I move to amend the motion to replace ‘Dictator-for-Life’ with ‘Dictator-in-Chief for Life’.”</p>
            <p>“I second that motion.”</p>
            <p>These are secondary motions and they become the motion on the floor and the new subject of discussion. If they are discussable, that is. Some, like a motion to call the question, are not discussable so it immediately becomes time to vote.</p>
            <p>At some point someone will “call the question,” i.e. move that we take a vote. Although if you wait for that, we’ll all die of old age in a room with no air conditioning. If you sense a consensus has formed, or that further discussion isn’t going to change things that’s a good time to pull out the ol’ “Is there any objection to calling the question?”</p>
            <p>If there isn’t, then we can vote.</p>
            <p>Voting!</p>
            <p>There are four useful methods of voting, roll call, show of hands, voice, and general consent.</p>
            <p>Roll call is the obvious one. Call out each name, find out how they are voting and count them up. This is required for funding matters (city rules). You can ask the secretary to call the roll. In their absence the vice-chair will usually be able to pick up the slack. Funding votes should also be recorded in board action forms.</p>
            <p>Show of hands is obvious too. It’s important to ask for ayes, noes, and abstentions. You don’t <em>have</em> to count the hands, but if there is any uncertainty you should call for a vote again. If you do count them, I recommend announcing the count for the record. If you don’t count, David will ask what the count was. Feel free to ignore him.</p>
            <p>“The motion on the floor is to appoint Damien Burke Dictator-in-Chief for Life. Show of hands: All those in favor?” (count) “Opposed?” (count) “Abstentions?” (They don’t count.)</p>
            <p>I like voice vote for substantive but uncontroversial matters.</p>
            <p>“The motion on the floor is to approve the minutes of the July 2019 meeting. All those in favor say ‘Aye’.” (A chorus of ayes) “All those opposed say ’Nay’” (Silence) “The ‘ayes’ have it, the minutes are approved.” (Gavel strike)</p>
            <p>General consent is great for unsubstantial and uncontroversial matters. I should have used it more often for minutes.</p>
            <p>“Is there any objection to approving the minutes of the July 2019 board meeting? Hearing none, the minutes are approved.” (Gavel strike)</p>
            <p>No-one objected, therefore you have “general consent.”</p>
            <p>After a vote, it is the presiding officer’s duty and privilege to declare the result. And punctuate it with a gavel strike. For roll call votes the secretary (me) will tell you the vote counts, but the presiding officer is still the one to declare the result.</p>
            <p>Also, almost every official action is decided by a majority of those voting.</p>
            <p>Note that is different from a plurality. For instance, if nine members voted for me to be secretary, five members voted for Tabatha, and five members voted for Doug, no one would be elected. 9 of 19 is not a majority. We would just need to vote again.</p>
            <p>Also note that abstentions are not votes. I have had a situation where we had 11 board members present and when the time came to approve the minutes, there were 3 ayes, 0 noes, and 8 abstentions. We need a quorum of eleven to do any business, but nonetheless, official action of the board requires only a majority of those voting and abstentions are not votes.</p>
            <p>Finally, board members love to hear themselves talk. If the last speaker, or two speakers, or three speakers were on one side of the motion, I find it useful to ask if anyone one would like to speak on the opposite side. If not, there is probably no reason to keep talking, just call the question.</p>
            <p>Finally, finally, no one should be speaking unless they have been given the floor by the chair. This is a difficult thing to maintain.</p>
            <p>And on a given issue, let everyone who wants to speak once before allowing anyone to speak a second time. Everyone should get a fixed amount of time (I like 2 minutes). We have a timer. According to the bylaws it is the Vice-chair’s job to run that timer.</p>
            <p>Board members like to talk and will engage in lengthy back-and-forths if you let them. Most of the time, nothing good will come of that.</p>
            <p>The Executive Committee</p>
            <p>The Executive Committee consists of the board officers, Chair, Vice-chair, Treasurer, and Secretary. The Executive Committee sets the agenda for the Board. The Board Chair has almost complete discretion in setting the agenda following or in the absence of an executive committee meeting. (HSDNC Bylaws art IIX sec 2)</p>
            <p>Currently, the Executive Committee meets on the first Monday of the month, 7:00pm, at the Columbia Square Community Room.</p>
            <p>This is my checklist to prepare for EXCOM meetings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Upload previous meeting minutes https://hsdnc.nationbuilder.com/admin/sites/1/pages/804/events_old</li>
              <li>Request location by emailing: TenantServicesCS@kilroyrealty.com</li>
              <li>Confirm location</li>

              <li>Change date on MERS in the agenda</li>

              <li>Upload agenda to event: https://www.hsdnc.org/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tribe_events</li>
              <li>Verify event and agenda appear on agenda page http://www.hsdnc.org/agendas</li>
              <li>Add agenda to board member packet</li>
              <li>Add minutes to board member packet</li>

              <li>Keep copy of board packet for yourself</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I shared the Google Drive documents with the Board and EXCOM agendas in them. Let me know if you need any help with those.</p>
            <p>The board member packet is something I started when I was chair. I got tired of waiting while board members got copies of all the documents they needed (minutes, MER’s, etc.) so I printed out copies of everything they needed beforehand. I can continue this as secretary but I would need the agenda, minutes, MERs and things well before the Board meeting.</p>
