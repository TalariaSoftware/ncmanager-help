Once you have
had your committee meeting
the hard work is done.
But there are still
some things to do
to make your committee effective
as well as compliant
with relevant laws and regulations.

After your committee meeting
you need to
[publish the meeting minutes](publish-minutes),
[publish updated and approved minutes](publish-approved-minutes),
and get committee [recommendations
onto the board agenda](get-on-board-agenda).

This is all the responsibility
of the chair,
but of course
she can delegate it
however she sees fit.
