title: Appoint a Chair

Every committee needs a chair.[^cochairs]
The committee chair is responsible
for appointing members,
scheduling meetings,
drafting agendas,
presiding over meetings,
taking minutes,
and reporting back to the board.
The chair is also
a member
of the committee.

It is a lot of work
to be a committee chair.
Fortunately,
the chairperson can delegate
any or all of it
to people
they trust.

The committee chair is usually appointed
by a majority vote
of the board.[^majorityvote]

[^cochairs]:
    Some NCs like
    to appoint
    multiple chairs or co-chairs
    to a committee.
    The goal is
    to share the workload
    or to make sure that
    at least one chair
    is available
    when needed.

    This introduces the risk
    of not having
    a single authority.
    If the co-chairs disagree
    on what goes
    into the agenda,
    there is no way
    to resolve the disagreement.[^ronrcochairs

    It is also unnecessary.
    A committee chair can delegate
    any of their duties
    to anyone else
    as they see fit
    to share the workload.

[^ronrcochairs]:
    "The anomalous title 'co-chairman'
    should be avoided,
    as it causes impossible dilemmas
    in attempts
    to share the functions
    of a single position."

[^majorityvote]:
    This is described
    in Article VII, section 3, paragraph B
    of the NC Bylaws.
    For example:
    "All Committee Chairs shall
    be appointed
    by a majority vote
    of the board."
    If the bylaws are silent,
    Robert's Rules of Order
    describe ways the chair
    may be appointed.
