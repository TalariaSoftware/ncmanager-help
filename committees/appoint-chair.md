Every committee needs a chair.[^cochairs]
The committee chair is responsible
for appointing members,
scheduling meetings,
drafting agendas,
presiding over meetings,
taking minutes,
and reporting back to the board.
The chair is also
a member
of the committee.

It is a lot of work
to be a committee chair.
Fortunately,
the chairperson can delegate
any or all of it
to people
they trust
will complete it successfully.

The committee chair is appointed
by majority vote
of the board.[^majorityvote]

[^cochairs]:
    Some NCs like
    to appoint
    multiple chairs or co-chairs
    to a committee.
    The goal is
    to share the workload
    or to make sure that
    at least one chair
    is available
    when needed.

    This introduces the risk
    of not having
    a single authority.
    If the co-chairs disagree
    on what goes
    into the agenda,
    there is no way
    to resolve the disagreement.

    It is also unnecessary.
    A committee chair can delegate
    any of their duties
    to anyone else
    as they see fit
    to share the workload.

[^majorityvote]:
    This is described
    in Article VII, section 3, paragraph B
    of the NC Bylaws.
    For example:
    "All Committee Chairs shall
    be appointed
    by a majority vote
    of the board."
