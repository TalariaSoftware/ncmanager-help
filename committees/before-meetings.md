Once you have a committee,
it's time
to get ready
for your meeting.

Before you can have
a committee meeting,
you need an [agenda](create-agenda)
and that agenda
will need to be posted
to [ENS](early-notification-system),
on the [NC website](post-on-the-web),
and at a [physical location](post-physically).

This is the responsibility
of the chair,
but of course,
they can delegate it
however they see fit.
