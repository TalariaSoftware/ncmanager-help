An agenda
lets everyone know
what is going
to be discussed
in the meeting.
This helps people decide
whether or not
they should attend
and also helps them
show up prepared
when they do
attend the meeting.

The Brown Act requires
that every topic
that is going
to be discussed
appear on the agenda
and that nothing is discussed
that is not
on the agenda
or outside
of a properly agendized and noticed meeting.
This is so
everyone can be
aware of
and participate in
the deliberations of government.

## What Goes in the Agenda

### Who, When, and Where

The first thing you need
on your agenda
is a description
of what committee is meeting, when, and where.
Be sure to include enough detail
so that anyone
who wants to
can join.

Example:

      Lake Woebegone Neighborhood Council Holiday Party Committee
      October 21, 2015 4:30
      Courthouse Mall Community Room
      100 Courthouse Square
      Hill Valley, CA 90000

If your meeting is being held virtually,
then the agenda needs
to include
all the information
people need
to be able
to attend.

Example:

      Lake Woebegone Neighborhood Council Holiday Party Committee
      October 21, 2015 4:30
      Teleconference meeting
      Attend via Zoom: https://zoom.us/j/987654321012
      Attend by phone by dialing 1-669-900-6833 and entering meeting id 987 6543 21012

### Agenda Items

Agenda items are the things
that the committee
may actually discuss
and take action on.

An agenda item should include
a title for easy reference,
and a brief description
of the item.
The description should be
as long as necessary
for the public to know
what is going
to be discussed
and as short
as possible.

Long descriptions are not
widely read
and can actually
obscure the information
in the description.
The Brown Act states that
a "brief general description
of an item
generally need not
exceed 20 words."[^549542]

### General Public Comment

The Brown Act requires that
every agenda include
an opportunity
for members
of the public
to directly address the committee
on any item
of interest
to the public
that is within
the committee's jurisdiction.[^549543]

In fact,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE)
will not publish
an agenda
that doesn't
include this item.

Example:

    General Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items

[^549542]: Cal. Gov. Code ยง 54954.2
[^549543]: Cal. Gov. Code ยง 54954.3

### Approval of the Minutes

Board of Neighborhood Commissioner policy requires
that minutes
of a board meeting
be on the agenda
for approval
during a subsequent regular board meeting.[^bonc201601]

For committees it is
a good practice
to keep minutes
and have them approved
at subsequent meetings
so there is a record
of what was decided
in committee.

Example:

    Approval of the Minutes of Previous Meeting(s)

[^bonc201601]: Board of Neighborhood Commissioners Policy [2016-01](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amended-Minutes-Policy-Resolution1-03.18.19.pdf)

### Adjournment

Every meeting ends eventually,
even if
it doesn't seem
like it ever will.

Adjourning a meeting
is an official action
of the assembly,
so like everything else
the assembly does,
it should be listed
as an action item.

Example:

    Adjournment

### Public Access of Records

The Department of Neighborhood Empowerment requires
that all Neighborhood Council agendas
include language
describing the public's access
to records
as ensured
by the Brown Act.

In fact,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE)
will not publish
an agenda that doesn't
include this information.

Example:

    *Public Posting of Agendas* Example NC agendas are posted for public review
    at the Example Community Center, 123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA 98765 and
    www.example.org. You can also receive our agendas via email by subscribing
    to the Early Notification System at https://www.lacity.org/subscriptions.

### Americans with Disabilities Act

The Department of Neighborhood Empowerment requires
that all Neighborhood Council agendas
include information
about the public's rights
under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

In fact,
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) will not publish
an agenda
that doesn't
include this information.

Example:

    *The Americans with Disabilities Act* As a covered entity under Title II of
    the Americans with Disabilities Act, the City of Los Angeles does not
    discriminate on the basis of disability and, upon request, will provide
    reasonable accommodation to ensure equal access to its programs, services
    and activities. Sign language interpreters, assistive listening devices and
    other auxiliary aids and/or services, may be provided upon request. To
    ensure availability of services, please make your request at least 3
    business days (72 hours) prior to the meeting you wish to attend by
    contacting George Washington, Board President, at (323) 555-1212 or
    president@example.org.
