title: Create an Agenda
---

An agenda lets everyone know what is going to be discussed in the meeting. This
let's everyone know whether or not they should attend and also helps people show
up prepared when they do attend the meeting.

Also the Brown Act requires that every topic that is going to be discussed appear on
the agenda and that nothing be discussed that is not on the agenda or outside of
a properly agendized and noticed meeting. This is so everyone can be aware of an
participate in the deliberation of government.

## What Goes in the Agenda

### Who, When, and Where

The first thing you need on your agenda is a description of what committee is
meeting, when, and where. Be sure to include enough details so that anyone who
wants to can join.

Example:

      Lake Woebegone Neighborhood Council Holiday Party Committee
      October 21, 2015 4:29
      Courthouse Mall Community Room
      100 Courthouse Square
      Hill Valley, CA 90000

If your meeting is being held virtually, then the agenda needs to include
all the information people need to be able to attend.

Example:

      Lake Woebegone Neighborhood Council Holiday Party Committee
      October 21, 2015 4:29
      Teleconference meeting
      Attend via Zoom: https://zoom.us/j/987654321012
      Attend by phone by dialing 1-669-900-6833 and entering meeting id 987 6543 21012

### Agenda Items

Agenda items are the things that the committee may actually discuss and take
action on.

An agenda item should include a title for easy reference, and a brief
description of the item. The description should be as long as necessary for the
public to know what is going to be discussed and as short as possible.

Long descriptions not widely read and can actually obscure the information in
the description. The Brown Act actually states that a "brief general description
of an item genearlly need not exceed 20 words."[^549542]

#### General Public Comment

The Brown Act requires that every agenda include an opportunity for members of
the public to directly address the committee on any item of interest to the
public that is within its jurisdiction.[^549543]

In fact, the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) will not publish an
agenda that doesn't include this item.

Example:

    General Public Comment on Non-Agenda Items.

#### New Business

New business is an opportunity for community members or members of the public to
present new things for the committee to consider and discuss.

Under the Brown Act, the only things that
