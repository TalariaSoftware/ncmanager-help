An agenda
lets everyone know
the topics
of the meeting.
This helps people decide
whether or not
they should attend
and also helps them
show up prepared
when they do
attend the meeting.

The Brown Act requires
that every topic
that is going
to be discussed
appear on the agenda
and that nothing is discussed
that is not
on the agenda
or outside
of a properly agendized and noticed meeting.
This is so
everyone can be
aware of
and participate in
the deliberations of government.
