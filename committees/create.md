There are two types of neighborhood council committees, standing and ad hoc.

## Standing Committees

Standing committees are designed to exist in perpetuity. They are defined in
neighborhood council bylaws. You can read Article VII, section 1 of your NC
bylaws to see what standing committees exist.

In order to create a new standing committee, you need to modify the NC bylaws.
Article XIII of the bylaws describes how to make amendments.

## Ad Hoc

Ad hoc committees are designed to be short-lived. They usually have a maximum
term of 1 year.[^maxterm]

Ad hoc committees are created by official action of the Board.

    See Article VII section 2 of the NC bylaws.
