There are
two types
of neighborhood council committees,
standing and ad hoc.

## Standing Committees

Standing committees are designed
to exist
in perpetuity.
They are defined
in the neighborhood council bylaws.
Article VII, section 1
of your NC bylaws show
what standing committees exist.

In order
to create
a new standing committee,
you need
to modify
the NC bylaws.
Article XIII
of the bylaws
describes how
to make amendments.

## Ad Hoc

Ad hoc committees are designed
to be short-lived.
They usually have
a maximum term
of 1 year.[^maxterm]

Ad hoc committees are created
by official action
of the Board.

    See Article VII section 2
    of the NC bylaws.
