title: Direction and Intent
---

Like all of us, a committee needs a reason to exist. It needs a purpose and a
goal.

For neighborhood council committees, the direction and intent is set by official
action of the neighborhood council board.[^direction]

Committee directives should be specific enough to focus the committee, but broad
enough to allow the committee flexibility to develop creative solutions.

Here is an example directive for a Holiday Party Ad Hoc Committee:

> Create a budget and plan for the Neighborhood Council's annual holiday party to be held in December of this year.

[^direction]:
    This is described in Article VII of the NC bylaws. Example text: "The
    creation, direction, intent, and guidelines of all Standing and Ad Hoc
    Committees will be decided by official action."
