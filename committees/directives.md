Like all of us,
a committee needs
a reason
to exist.
It needs
a purpose and a goal.

For neighborhood council committees,
the direction and intent is set
by official action
of the neighborhood council board.[^direction]

Committee directives should be specific enough
to focus the committee,
but broad enough
to allow the committee flexibility
to develop creative solutions.

Here is an example directive
for a Holiday Party Ad Hoc Committee:

> Create a budget and plan for the Neighborhood Council's annual holiday party to be held in December of this year.

[^direction]:
    This is described
    in Article VII
    of the NC bylaws.
    For example:
    "The creation, direction, intent, and guidelines
    of all Standing and Ad Hoc Committees
    will be decided
    by official action."
