You established a committee,
scheduled a meeting,
created,
and then published the agenda.
Now it's time
to do the real work.
It's time to
get together, discuss, and take actions
on the important issues.
It's time
to have a committee meeting.

During your committee meeting
you need someone
to [preside over the meeting](preside)
and you need someone
to [take minutes](take-minutes).

This is all
the responsibility
of the chair.
In a small, informally-run committees
it is common
for the chair
to do it themselves,
but of course
they can delegate it
however they see fit.
