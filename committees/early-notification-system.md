The Early Notification System (ENS) exists so the city can distribute
information about the City Council as well as other commissions, committees,
departments and boards, including neighborhood councils. Interested members of
the public can sign up and receive, via email, agendas for city meetings.

It is a valuable tool for the public to stay aware of what is happening
in city government.

ENS was proscribed in the same part of the City Charter that created
Neighborhood Councils.[^plansec907] It was further defined in the Plan for
Neighborhood Councils.[^planart8]

Finally, BONC policy requires all neighborhood council committees submit a copy
of all agendas to to be posted through ENS.[^bonc2014011]

To submit your committee agenda to be posted to ENS, email it as a PDF file to
ncsupport@lacity.org with the date and title of the meeting as the subject.
