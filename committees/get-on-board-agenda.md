All actions, recommendations, and policies of an NC committee are subject to
approval by official action of the board.[^bylaws73A] But the board can only
approve things that are on their agenda.

Thus if your committee has made any recommendations, it's important to get that
on the board agenda do the board can act on it.

The board agenda is usually set by the board president/chair so your should make
sure they know to put your committee's recommendations onto the board
agenda.[^bylaws82]

[^bylaws73A]:
    This is laid out in Article VII, Section 3, subsection A of the NC bylaws.

[^bylaws82]:

    agenda is set.
