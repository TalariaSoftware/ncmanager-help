All actions, recommendations, and policies
of an neighborhood council committee
are subject
to approval
by official action
of the board.[^bylaws73A]
But the board
can only approve things
that are
on their agenda.

Thus, if your committee
has made any recommendations,
it's important
to get that
on the board agenda
so the board
can act on it.

The board agenda is usually set
by the board president or chair.
Make sure they know to put
your committee's recommendations
onto the board agenda.[^bylaws82]

[^bylaws73A]:
    This is laid out
    in Article VII, Section 3, subsection A
    of the neighborhood council bylaws.

[^bylaws82]:
    Check your NC bylaws,
    Article VIII, Section 2,
    for details on how
    the board agenda is set.
