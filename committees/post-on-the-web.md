In the twenty-first century,
one of the best ways
to communicate
with the general public
is through a website.
If your neighborhood council
has a website,
(and it should)
you should post your committee agendas there.

<aside class="callout" role="complementary" markdown="1">
NCMS makes
it is easy
to [create PDF agendas](/ncms/agenda-pdfs)
to post
on your neighborhood council website.
</aside>

BONC policy[^bonc2014011] requires
that all committee agendas
are posted
on the NC website
or a page made available
at EmpowerLA
and that the postings are
"Brown Act time compliant,"
meaning 72 hours in advance
for regular meetings
and 24 hours in advance
for special meetings.

If your NC does not
have a website
contact your Neighborhood Empowerment Advocate
at the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment
and they will
make a page available
to your NC
on the EmpowerLA website.
