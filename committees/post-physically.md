Not everyone in your neighborhood has easy access to the web or knows to check
your neighborhood council's website. It is important to post your committee
agendas in a public location, so that every one can remained informed about
upcoming meetings.

BONC policy requires physically posting an agenda for all NC Committee
meetings.[^bonc2014011] In addition, the NC must notify DONE of the location of
these postings.[^postinglocation]

Find out this location for your Neighborhood Council, and post your agenda there
at least seventy-two hours before a regular meetings and twenty-four hours
before a special meeting.
