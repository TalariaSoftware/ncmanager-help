Not everyone
in your neighborhood
has easy access
to the web
or knows to check
your neighborhood council website.
It is important to post
your committee agendas
in a public location,
so that everyone
can remain informed
about upcoming meetings.

BONC policy requires
physically posting an agenda
for all NC committee meetings.[^bonc2014011]
In addition,
the NC must notify DONE
of the location
of these postings.[^postinglocation]

Find out this location
for your Neighborhood Council,
and post your agenda there
at least seventy-two hours
before a regular meetings
and twenty-four hours
before a special meeting.
