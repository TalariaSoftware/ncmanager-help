Once you are
in a meeting,
it is the responsibility
of the chair
or their
designee,
to preside
over the meeting.

Preside is,
for the most part,
a fancy word
for facilitate.

The person presiding
over the meeting
leads the meeting
and makes sure
that the committee
efficiently tackles
all the items
on the agenda,
hears from everyone
who wants
to participate,
and guides the committee
to make decisions.

Remember,
an NC committee cannot do anything
on its own;
it can only recommend actions
to the NC board.
The more voices
that are included
in those recommendations
the more likely
the board is
to act on them.

Parliamentary procedure,
such as defined
by *Robert's Rules of Order*,
provides a very complete framework
for leading these meetings.
However,
most committees are small
and do not need
anywhere near
that level of formality.
