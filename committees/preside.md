title: Preside Over the Meeting
---

Once you are in a meeting, it is the responsibility of the chair or their
designee, to preside over the meeting.

Preside is, for the most part, a fancy word for facilitate or lead.

The person presiding over the meeting leads the meeting and makes sure that the
committee efficiently tackles all the items on the agenda, hears from everyone
who wants to participate, and guides the committee to make decisions.

Remember, a NC committee cannot do anything on it's own; it can only recommend
actions to the NC board. The more voices are included in those recommendations
the more likely the board is to act on them.

Parliamentary procedure, such as defined by *Robert's Rules of Order*, provides
a very complete framework leading these meetings. However, most small
committee's do not need anywhere near that level of formality.
