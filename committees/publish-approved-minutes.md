One of the most important things
that a neighborhood council committee does
at a meeting
is approve the minutes
of the previous meeting.
Approving the minutes shows
that the committee agrees
that the minutes are
a correct record
of what transpired
at the earlier meeting.

Once the minutes
are approved
they should be updated
to show that
they were approved
and the date
they were approved on.
The updated minutes
should be published
on the neighborhood council website
and wherever else
your neighborhood council records are kept.
