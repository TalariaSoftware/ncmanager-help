One of the most important things that an NC committee does at a meeting is
approve the minutes of the previous meeting. Approving the minutes shows that
the committee agrees that the minutes are a correct record of what transpired at
the earlier meeting.

Once the minutes are approved they should be updated to show that they were
approved and the date they were approved on. The updated minutes should be
published on the NC website and wherever else your NC's records are kept.
