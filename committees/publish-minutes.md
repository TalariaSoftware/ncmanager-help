title: Publish the Minutes

Your neighborhood council committee is a government body and the minutes are the
record of what that government body has done. You should publish your committee
minutes right away to make them available to the general public.

Publishing your minutes right away also allows committee members to review them
while the meeting is fresh in their mind. This is helpful when it comes time to
approve the minutes at the next meeting.

You should publish your committee minutes on the web so everyone who is
interested can find them.

I also recommend emailing a copy of the minutes to the committee members so they
are prompted to review them right away.

Finally, if you have a mailing list of people who are interested in your NC or
your NC committee, you may want to email the minutes to that list also.
