Committees are
the most important part
of the neighbhorhood council system.
They are where
the work
of the neighborhood councils
gets done.

The board is the governing body
of the neighborhood council[^governingbody].
They make
all the decisions
of the neighborhood councils.[^subjecttoapproval]

Because
the board deals with
everything in the neighborhood,
there is not
enough time
in board meetings
to discuss
most issues
in depth.
Committees are
a place
for people
who are most
interested and informed
about an issue
to discuss it
in depth
and to form
a recommendation
for the board
to act on.

A well-run committee
will hash out
difficult items
and issue recommendations
to the board
that have broad support.
This then
makes it possible
for the board
to act faster
and more efficiently
on a wider
range of items.

[^governingbody]:
    This is specified
    in Article V
    of your Neighborhood Council bylaws.
    For example:
    "The Board shall be
    the Governing Body
    of the Council
    within the meaning
    of that term
    as set forth in
    the [Plan
    for a Citywide System
    of Neighborhood Councils](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Plan_Amended_12-18-131.pdf)."

[^subjecttoapproval]:
    Article VII, section 3, paragraph A
    of the NC bylaws
    limits the authority
    of committees.
    For example:
    "The actions, recommendations, and policies
    of all committees
    shall be subject
    to approval
    by official action
    of the Board."
