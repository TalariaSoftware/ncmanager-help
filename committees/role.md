title: Role of Committees
---

Committees are the most important part of the neighbhorhood council system. They
are where the work of the neighborhood councils get done.

The board is the governing body of the neighborhood council[^governingbody].
They make all the decisions of the neighborhood councils.[^subjecttoapproval]

Because the board deals with everything in the neighborhood, there is not enough
time in board meetings to discuss most issues in depth. Committees are an
place where a people who are most interested and informed about an issue to
discuss it in depth and form a recommendation for the board to act on.

A well-run committee will hash out difficult items and issue recommendations to
the board that have broad support. This makes it possible for the board to then
act faster and more efficiently on a broader range of things.

[^governingbody]:
    This is specified in Article V of the your Neighborhood Council bylaws which
    usually says something like "The Board shall be the Governing Body of the
    Council within the meaning of that term as set forth in the [Plan for a
    Citywide System of Neighborhood
    Councils](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Plan_Amended_12-18-131.pdf)."

[^subjecttoapproval]:
    Article VII, section 3, paragraph A of the NC bylaws limits the authority of
    committees. For example, "The actions, recommendations, and policies of all
    committees shall be subject to approval by official action of the Board."
