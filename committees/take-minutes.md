Once you are
in a meeting,
it is the responsibility
of the chair
or their designee
to take minutes
of the meeting.[^bylawscommitteeminutes]

Minutes are the record
of your committee meeting.
They should say
when and where the committee met,
which committee members were there,
and what actions were taken
by the committee.

Committee minutes are usually
the responsibility
of the chair,
but of course
they can delegate it
however they see fit.

[^bylawscommitteeminutes]:
    This may be
    required by
    the NC bylaws
    (see article VII, section 3
    paragraph on Committee Meetings).
    Even if it is not
    it is still
    a very good practice
    for the committee.
