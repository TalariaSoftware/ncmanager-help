Take a look
at the [Minutes Guide](/minutes)
for information
about taking minutes
at a neighborhood council meeting.
</aside>

Once you are
in a meeting,
it is the responsibility
of the chair,
or their designee,
to take minutes
of the meeting.[^bylawscommitteeminutes]

Minutes are the record
of your committee meeting.
They should say
when and where the committee met,
which committee members were there,
and what actions the committee took.

Committee minutes are usually
the responsibility
of the chair,
but of course
they can delegate it
however they see fit.

[^bylawscommitteeminutes]:
    This may be
    required by
    the NC bylaws
    (see article VII, section 3
    paragraph on Committee Meetings).
    Even if it is not,
    it is still
    a very good practice
    for the committee.
