The neighborhood council system has made it easier than ever for people to have a role in city government. That means it’s easier than ever to do your part to make government more responsive to local needs.

But if you don’t know how to work inside government, with the extensive rules, regulations, legal processes, you need someone you can trust to support you in the process.

I’ve been part of the neighborhood council system since 2015. I’ve been the a committee chair, board chair, and board secretary. I’ve spent years helping my local NC run more smoothly and now I want to do the same for yours.

If you’ve ever wanted expert support to help your NC runs as smoothly as possible, it’s possible that NCMS, Neighborhood Council Management System, can help.

## How it Works

After you sign up for your free two-month trial, I will set up an account for your and your neighborhood council. You’ll get an email with instructions on how to log in so you can explore the app for yourself.

Then we’ll schedule a video call meeting. I’ll give you a walkthrough through the app, make sure you know how the every part of it works, and answer any questions you have.

You will then be ready to use NCMS to create agenda, manage meetings, take minutes, and fill out board action certifications for your NC board and all of its committees.

Also, if you have other members of your NC that want to use NCMS, you can create accounts for them and they can get the same one-on-one training. I find this is useful for all board officers and committee chairs.

I will check-in from time to time, generally before and after each meeting, to see what’s going well and what can be improved. Your feedback will contribute to the ongoing continuous improvement of NCMS.

After your two-month trial is over we’ll talk again. I’ll ask if NCMS has been helpful in your work with your neighborhood council. If it has, I’ll ask you to go to your NC board and ask for funding of $300 per month to keep using it. That way, you’ll get continued access to NCMS and I’ll get more resources to continue improving for your NC and others.
