# Guides

Being a part
of a neighborhood council
means doing
the difficult, tedious, and time-consuming work
of complying with
Robert's Rules of Order,
the NC bylaws,
regulations from the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
the City Charter,
the Brown Act,
the California Public Records Act,
and more.

These guides,
along with the Neighborhood Council Management System (NCMS)
are designed to
make it easier,
so you can spend
more of your time
making government
more responsive
to local needs.

## The Board

The governing board is probably
the most well-known part
of the neighborhood council system.
In some senses,
the board is
the neighborhood council.

This guide is designed
to give you
everything you need
to lead your board
to success.
