  <p>
  Being a part
  of a neighborhood council
  means doing
  the difficult, tedious, and time-consuming work
  of complying with
  Robert's Rules of Order,
  the NC bylaws,
  regulations from the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
  the City Charter,
  the Brown Act,
  the California Public Records Act,
  and more.
  </p>

  <p>
  These guides,
  along with the Neighborhood Council Management System (NCMS)
  are designed to
  make it easier,
  so you can spend
  more of your time
  making government
  more responsive
  to local needs.
