  <p>
  Getting involved
  with a neighborhood council
  is a powerful way
  to participate
  in local government
  and help make city government
  more responsive
  to local needs.
  </p>

  <p>
  But it also
  requires doing
  the difficult, tedious, and time-consuming work
  of complying with
  Robert's Rules of Order,
  the neighborhood council bylaws,
  regulations from the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
  the City Charter,
  the Brown Act,
  the California Public Records Act,
  and more.
  </p>

  <p>
  These guides,
  along with the Neighborhood Council Management System (NCMS)
  are designed to
  make it easier,
  so you can spend
  more of your time
  representing your community
  and making government
  more responsive
  to local needs.
