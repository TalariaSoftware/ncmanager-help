# Guides

Being a part
of a neighborhood council
means doing
the difficult, tedious, and time-consuming work
of complying with
Robert's Rules of Order,
the NC bylaws,
regulations from the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
the City Charter,
the Brown Act,
the California Public Records Act,
and more.

These guides,
along with the Neighborhood Council Management System (NCMS)
are designed to
make it easier,
so you can spend
more of your time
making government
more responsive
to local needs.
