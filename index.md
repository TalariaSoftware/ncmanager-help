  Being a part
  of a neighborhood council
  means doing
  the difficult, tedious, and time-consuming work
  of complying with
  Robert's Rules of Order,
  the NC bylaws,
  regulations from the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
  the City Charter,
  the Brown Act,
  the California Public Records Act,
  and more.

  along with the Neighborhood Council Management System (NCMS)
  are designed to
  make it easier,
  so you can spend
  more of your time
  making government

        the neighborhood council.

        An agenda
        lets everyone know
        what is going
        to be discussed
        in the meeting.
        The Brown Act requires
        that everything
        that is going
        to be discussed
        appear on the agenda.

        Minutes are
        the official record
        of neighborhood council
        meetings.
        They say
        what assembly met,
        when and where
        the meeting was held,
        what members
        were present,
        and what actions
        were taken
        by the assembly.
