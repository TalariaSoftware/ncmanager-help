  regulations from the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
  the City Charter,
  the Brown Act,
  the California Public Records Act,
  and more.

        An agenda
        lets everyone know
        what is going
        to be discussed
        in the meeting.
        The Brown Act requires
        that everything
        that is going
        to be discussed
        appear on the agenda.
