The Board
of Neighborhood Commissioners requires
that the minutes
for neighborhood council
board meetings
specify how the neighborhood council
counts abstentions.[^boncabstentions]:

Most neighborhood councils
do not count
abstentions as votes.
For them
the notice
could look
like this:

    The neighborhood council does not count abstentions as votes.

Some neighborhood councils
count abstentions
as yes votes.
For them
the notice
could look
like this:

    The neighborhood council counts abstentions as yes votes.

How a neighborhood council
counts abstentions
is described
by their bylaws
in article V, section 3.

[^boncabstentions]:
    "The minutes shall also
    note how
    the Neighborhood Council
    counts abstentions."
