Minutes taken
at a meeting
do not become
the official record until
they are approved.
Until then
they are draft minutes
and should be
clearly marked
as such.[^ronr4112]

For example:

    Draft minutes --- not yet approved

Once the minutes
have been approved,
they should
be marked
as approved
with the date
they were approved on.[^ronr4814]

For example:

    Approved on March 2, 2021

[^ronr4112]:
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 41:12

[^ronr4814]:
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 48:14
