Minutes taken
at a meeting
become the official record
of the assembly
after they are approved
by the assembly.
Until then,
they are draft minutes
and should be
clearly marked
as such.[^ronr4112]

NCMS makes
it easy
to [create approved minutes.](/ncms/approved-minutes)
</aside>

For example:

> Draft minutes --- not yet approved

Once the minutes
have been approved,
they should
state that,
along with the date
that they were approved.[^ronr4814]

For example:

> Approved on March 2, 2021

[^ronr4112]:
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 41:12

[^ronr4814]:
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 48:14
