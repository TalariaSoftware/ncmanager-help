The minutes should
indicate which members
are present
at the meeting.
This provides verification
that the assembly
had quorum to act.
It also provides
an official record
so that members
can be held accountable
for their attendance
or lack thereof.[^bylawsattendance]

To achieve this
the minutes should include
the roll call
at the beginning
of a meeting,
and a note
when any members arrive
after the meeting
is called to order
or leave
before the meeting
is adjourned.
This is required
by the Board
of Neighborhood Commissioners
for neighborhood council boards[^boncattendance]
and is also
a good idea
for NC committees.

Example:

    [10:32 am] The roll was called.
    Present (3): Janet Della-Denunzio, Tahani Al-Jamil, and Chidi Anagonye
    Absent (1): Jason Mendoza

    [10:34 am] Eleanor Shellstrop arrived at the meeting
    [10:36 am] Jason Mendoza left the meeting

[^bylawsattendance]:
    See the NC bylaws
    article V section 7
    for board member
    attendance requirements.

[^boncattendance]:
     "Minutes shall contain
     at a minimum
     the following information: ...
     2. The roll call
     of Neighborhood Council board members,
     noting the time
     of any members
     who arrive
     after the meting
     is called to order
     or who leave
     before the adjournment
     of the meeting."
