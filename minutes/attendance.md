The minutes should
indicate which members
are present
at the meeting.
This provides verification
that the assembly
had quorum to act.
It also provides
an official record
so that members
can be held accountable
for their attendance
or lack thereof.[^bylawsattendance]

<aside class="callout" role="complementary" markdown="1">
NCMS makes
it is easy
to [take roll](/ncms/roll-call)
and to note [arrivals and departures.](/ncms/arrivals-and-departures)
</aside>

To achieve this,
the minutes should include
the roll call
at the beginning
of a meeting,
and a note
when any members arrive
after the meeting
is called to order
or leave
before the meeting
is adjourned.
This is required
by the Board
of Neighborhood Commissioners
for neighborhood council boards[^boncattendance]
and is also
a good idea
for neighborhood council committees.

Example:

> [10:32 am] The roll was called.  
> Present (3): Tahani Al-Jamil, Chidi Anagonye, Jason Mendoza  
> Absent (1): Eleanor Shellstrop  
>
> [10:34 am] Eleanor Shellstrop arrived at the meeting  
> [10:36 am] Jason Mendoza left the meeting

    article V section 7
