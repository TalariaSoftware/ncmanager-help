The body
of the minutes
should end with
the last thing
that happened
in the meeting,
to wit,
the adjournment
and the time it happened.[^ronradjourn]

Because it is
the last thing
that happened
at the meeting,
it should be
the last item
in the body
of the meeting minutes.

For example:

    [7:55 pm] Meeting adjourned.

[^ronradjourn]:
    "The last paragraph
    should state:
    12) the hour
    of adjournment."
