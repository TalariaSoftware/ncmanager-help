title: Minutes
---

Minutes are the official record of neighborhood council body (boards and
committees) meetings. They say what body met, when and where the meeting was
held, what members of the body were present, and what actions were taken by the
body.

This guide is designed to give you everything you need to create excellent
minutes for your neighborhood council.

## Why take minutes

### Regulatory requirements

The Board of Neighborhood Commissioners requires that NC boards keep written
minutes of all board meetings.[^bonc201601]

The NC Bylaws may also require that minutes are taken at committee meetings.[^bylawscommitteeminutes]

Parlimentary procedure also requires minute taking.[^ronr36]

[^bonc201601]:
      "Neighborhood Councils shall keep _written_ minutes of all regular and
      special board meetings."
      Los Angeles, CA,
      Board of Neighborhood Commissioners,
      [Policy No. 2016-01 (1),](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amended-Minutes-Policy-Resolution1-03.18.19.pdf)

[^bylawscommitteeminutes]:
    This is likely to be in article VII, section 3,
    in the paragraph on Committee Meetings.


[^ronr36]:
    "The minimum essential officers for the conduct of business in a
    deliberative assembly are a presiding officer ... and a secretary, or clerk,
    who makes a written record of what is done---usually called 'the minutes.'"
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 3:6

### Recordkeeping

Perhaps more important than the regulatory requirements are the benefits of
taking minutes. Minutes are the record of NC meetings.

Written minutes allow NC members, stakeholders, and the general public to be
aware of NC board and committee activity. This transparency is vitally important
for an NC because it is a government body that should be answerable to its
stakeholders.

Written minutes also demonstrate agreement by the members of what the board or
committee has done. Written and approved minutes eliminate potential ambiguity
and uncertainty about the NC's actions.

## What goes in minutes

Parliamentary procedure[^ronr48] and regulations from the Board of Neighborhood
Commissioners[^boncreqs] set requirements for what must be included in the
minutes of a neighborhood council meeting.

Beyond those items, it is important to keep the minutes as short and simple as possible.

Traditionally, the minutes of the previous meeting are read at the beginning of
the meeting. Long, overly-detailed minutes will take up unnecesary time in a
meeting and are a bore to listen to.

Even if the minutes are distributed in advance and not read in the meeting, the
shorter the minutes are, the easier it is for members to read them, examine
them, and ensure their correctness.

Shorter minutes are not only easier to correct but will also have fewer mistakes
on average. The less the secretary needs to record the fewer opportunities for
mistakes they have and the easier it is to avoid them.

Shorter minutes also makes it easier for the person taking minutes to
participate in meeting. This is especially important for neighborhood councils
where the minute taker is usually an important member of a small board or
committee.

Finally, shorter minutes are easier to use as reference when researching or
verifying things done in previous meetings.

## Introduction

The first part of the minutes should indicate the name of the assembly, the
date, time, and location of the meeting, and whether it is a regular or special
meeting.[^ronr484]

[^ronr484]:
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 41:4(1)-(3)

For a regular board meeting that may look like this:

> Lake Woebegone Neighborhood Council
> Governing Board Regular Meeting
> April 1, 2021 7:00 pm
> Local Community Center, 123 Lake St, Los Angeles CA

A special committee meeting introduction could look like this:

> Lake Woebegone Neighborhood Council
> Party Committee Special Meeting
> April 1, 2021 7:00 pm
> Local Community Center, 123 Lake St, Los Angeles CA

## Approval

Minutes taken at a meeting do not become the official record until they are
approved. Until then they are draft minutes and should be clearly marked as
such.[^ronr4112]

For example:
> Draft minutes --- not yet approved

Once the minutes have been approved, they should be marked as approved along
with the date they were approved on.[^ronr4814]

For example:
> Approved on March 2, 2021

    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 48:14

## Start

The body of the minutes should start with the first thing that happened in the
meeting, to wit, the call to order.

The call to order is when the presiding officer announces the start of the
meeeting.[^ronr315] The meeting minutes must contain the start time of the
meeting[^boncstarttime] and who is presiding[^ronr4844].

For example:
> [7:01 pm] Meeting called to order. Chidi Anagonye presiding.

[^ronr315]:
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 3:15

[^boncstarttime]:
     "Minutes shall contain at a minimum the following information: 1. The start
     time of the meeting" Los Angeles, CA, Board of Neighborhood Commissioners,
     [Policy No. 2016-01
     (1),](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amended-Minutes-Policy-Resolution1-03.18.19.pdf)

[^ronr4844]:
    "The first paragraph of the minutes should contain the following
    information: ... 4) the fact that the regular chairman and secretary were
    present or, in their absence, the names of the person who substituted for
    them."
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 48:4

## Attendance

The minutes should also indicate which members are present at the meeting. This
provides verification that the assembly had quorum to meet. It also provides
an official record so that members can be held accountable for the attendance or
lack thereof.[^bylawsattendance]

This requires not only a record of the roll call at the beginning of a meeting,
but also noting when any members arrive after the meeting is called to order or
leave before the meeting is adjourned. This is required by the Board of
Neighborhood Commissioners for neighborhood council boards[^boncattendance] and
is also a good idea for NC committees.

[^bylawsattendance]:
    See the NC bylaws article V section 7 for board member attendance
    requirements.

[^boncstarttime]:
     "Minutes shall contain at a minimum the following information: ... 2. The
     roll call of Neighborhood Council board members, noting the time of any
     members who arrive after the meting is called to order or who leave before
     the adjournment of the meeting." Los Angeles, CA, Board of Neighborhood
     Commissioners, [Policy No. 2016-01
     (1),](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amended-Minutes-Policy-Resolution1-03.18.19.pdf)
