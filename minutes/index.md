title: Minutes
---

Minutes are the official record of neighborhood council body (boards and
committees) meetings. They say what body met, when and where the meeting was
held, what members of the body were present, and what actions were taken by the
body.

This guide is designed to give you everything you need to create excellent
minutes for your neighborhood council.

## Why take minutes

### Regulatory requirements

The Board of Neighborhood Commissioners requires that NC boards keep written
minutes of all board meetings.[^bonc201601]

The NC Bylaws may also require that minutes are taken at committee meetings.[^bylawscommitteeminutes]

Parlimentary procedure also requires minute taking.[^ronr36]

[^bonc201601]:
      "Neighborhood Councils shall keep _written_ minutes of all regular and
      special board meetings."
      Los Angeles, CA,
      Board of Neighborhood Commissioners,
      [Policy No. 2016-01 (1),](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amended-Minutes-Policy-Resolution1-03.18.19.pdf)

[^bylawscommitteeminutes]:
    This is likely to be in article VII, section 3,
    in the paragraph on Committee Meetings.


[^ronr36]:
    "The minimum essential officers for the conduct of business in a
    deliberative assembly are a presiding officer ... and a secretary, or clerk,
    who makes a written record of what is done---usually called 'the minutes.'"
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 3:6

### Recordkeeping

Perhaps more important than the regulatory requirements are the benefits of
taking minutes. Minutes are the record of NC meetings.

Written minutes allow NC members, stakeholders, and the general public to be
aware of NC board and committee activity. This transparency is vitally important
for an NC because it is a government body that should be answerable to its
stakeholders.

Written minutes also demonstrate agreement by the members of what the board or
committee has done. Written and approved minutes eliminate potential ambiguity
and uncertainty about the NC's actions.
