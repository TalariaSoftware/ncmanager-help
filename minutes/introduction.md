The first part
of the minutes
is a description
of who, what, when, and where.

The minutes need
to have
the name
of the assembly
that met.[^ronr4842]
For neighborhood councils,
that is going to be
the governing board or
a committee
of the neighborhood council.

The minutes should indicate
if the meeting
was a regular meeting
or special meeting.[^ronr4841]

The minutes also need
to say
when and where
the meeting
was held.[^ronr4843]
On your minutes,
list the date
of the meeting
(with the year)
and the scheduled start time.

If the meeting
was held
in person,
include the address
in the minutes.
If the meeting
was held online,
that should
be noted instead
of a physcial address.
