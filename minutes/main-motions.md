Meeting minutes should
describe all
the actions considered
by the assembly
at the meeting.[^ronrallmain]
This means
all the main motions
that were
taken up
by the assembly
should be recorded
in the minutes.

</aside>

The description
of a main motion
should include
the final wording
of the motion[^ronrfinalwording]
as well
as how it was
disposed of.
Usually a motion
is voted on
and either passes or fails.
But it can also
be disposed of
by being postponed
or referred
to committee.

If the motion
was voted on,
the minutes
should include
the vote count,
the vote
of each board member
(yes, no, abstain, recused, ineligible, or absent),
and the outcome
of the vote
(passed or failed).[^boncactions]

The minutes should also
include the person
who made the motion,
but not the person
who seconded it.[^ronrmover]
