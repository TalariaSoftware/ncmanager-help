Meeting minutes
may also include
a record
of other actions
at the meeting
if necessary
for completeness or clarity.

Care should be taken
to limit extraneous information
as much as possible.
For example,
the "name and subject
of a guest speaker
can be given,
but no efforts
should be made
to summarize
[their] remarks."[^ronrguest]
