Parliamentary procedure[^ronr48]
and regulations
from the Board
of Neighborhood Commissioners[^boncreqs]
set requirements
for what must
be included
in the minutes
of a neighborhood council meeting.

Beyond those items,
it is important
to keep the minutes
as short and simple
as possible.

Traditionally,
the minutes
of the previous meeting
are read
at the beginning
of the meeting.
Long, overly-detailed minutes will
take up unnecesary time
in a meeting
and are a bore
to listen to.

Even if the minutes
are distributed
in advance
and not read
at the meeting,
the shorter
the minutes are,
the easier
it is for members
to read them,
examine them,
and ensure their correctness.

Shorter minutes
are not only
easier to correct
but will also
have fewer mistakes.
The less the secretary needs
to record
the fewer opportunities
for mistakes
they have
and the easier
it is
to avoid them.

Shorter minutes also
makes it easier
for the person
taking minutes
to participate
in the meeting.
This is especially important
for neighborhood councils
where the minute taker
is usually
an important member
of a small board
or committee.

Finally,
shorter minutes are easier
to use as reference
when researching
or verifying actions
from previous meetings.
