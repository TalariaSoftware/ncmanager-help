## Regulatory requirements

The Board
of Neighborhood Commissioners
requires that
neighborhood council boards
keep written minutes
of all board meetings.[^bonc201601]

Neighborhood council bylaws
often require
that minutes are taken
at committee meetings as well.[^bylawscommitteeminutes]

Finally, parliamentary procedure
also requires
taking minutes.[^ronr36]

[^bonc201601]:
      "Neighborhood Councils shall
      keep _written_ minutes
      of all regular and special
      board meetings."
      Los Angeles, CA,
      Board of Neighborhood Commissioners,
      [Policy No. 2016-01 (1),](https://empowerla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amended-Minutes-Policy-Resolution1-03.18.19.pdf)

[^bylawscommitteeminutes]:
    This is likely to be
    in article VII, section 3,
    in the paragraph
    on committee meetings.


[^ronr36]:
    "The minimum essential officers
    for the conduct
    of business
    in a deliberative assembly are
    a presiding officer ...
    and a secretary, or clerk,
    who makes a written record
    of what is done---usually
    called 'the minutes.'"
    RONR (12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;ed.) 3:6

## Recordkeeping

Perhaps more important
than the regulatory requirements
are the benefits
of taking minutes.
Minutes are
the official record
of neighborhood council meetings.

Written minutes allow
neighborhood council members, stakeholders,
and the general public
to be aware
of the neighborhood council's activity.
This transparency is
vitally important
for a neighborhood council
because it is
a government body
that should answer
to its stakeholders.

Written minutes also
demonstrate agreement
by the members
on what
the board or committee
has done.
Well-written and approved minutes eliminate
potential ambiguity
and uncertainty
about the neighborhood council's actions.
