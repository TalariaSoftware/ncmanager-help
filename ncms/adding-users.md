Every neighborhood council
that uses NCMS
can have
as many users
on their account
as they need or want.
Each user
can have authority
over individual committees,
the board,
or the whole NC.

This page describes
how to add new users
and grant (or revoke)
their authority.

## Committee Authority

A user
with authority
over a committee
can change anything
about that committee.
They can
add or remove meetings;
modify or delete minutes;
add or remove members; or
change any
of the committee settings.
They can also
grant the same authority
to other users.
