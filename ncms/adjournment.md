When taking minutes at a neighborhood council meeting, the last thing you want to record is what time did the meeting of churn.
So for that, we have the adjourn meeting button simple as this press the button, and it adds meeting adjourned with the current time.
Now, if you press the button late or turns out the meeting, actually hadn't been returned, you can always edit that with the added functionality.
I say, Oh no, I just wasn't paying attention. It actually adjourned at 1207 update the German. And there it is.
It shows up in the minutes as 1207. And that's how to record the meeting. Adjourn time using neighborhood council management system.
