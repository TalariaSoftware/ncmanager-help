When taking minutes at a neighborhood council meeting, the last thing you want to record is what time did the meeting adjourn.

For that, we have the adjourn meeting button. Simple as this, press the button, and it adds meeting adjourned with the current time.

If you press the button late or turns out the meeting actually hadn't adjourned, you can always edit that with the edit functionality. Oh no, I just wasn't paying attention. It actually adjourned at 12:07, update the adjournment. There it is. It shows up in the minutes as 12:07.

That's how to record the meeting adjourn time using the Neighborhood Council Management System.
