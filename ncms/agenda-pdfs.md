After you've created your neighborhood council meeting agenda, you're going to want to distribute it. You're going to want to send it to the early notification system, posted on the website, print it out and post it up in a physical location.
And for all these things you'll need a PDF file. So here's how to use the neighborhood council management system to create PDF files of your meeting agendas.
Here we are at the page for the Lake Wobegon party committee, regular meeting the July 3rd meeting. And you can see we're looking at the agenda over here, identity PDF.
There's two buttons, one to download a PDF that will download a directly to your file to your computer and the other to view it here in the browser, when you click that button and we can see this is what the PDF looks like.
It has all the information about the committee, the meeting, all the items of the meeting, and also the public notices that are required to be included in an input council agendas.
And that's how to use NCMS to create neighborhood council agenda PDFs.
