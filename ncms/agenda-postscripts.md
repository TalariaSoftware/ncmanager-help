Various laws and regulations required that certain notices are included on every neighborhood council agenda. Let's see how we can use neighborhood council management system.
So it makes sure that those are included. Every time we create an agenda for a neighborhood council meeting here, I am at the party committee, uh, the Lake Wobegon party committee page.
And if we scroll to the bottom, we can see, we have agenda post scripts. These are things that are added to the bottom or as a post-trip for after all the agenda items.
Whenever you create an agenda as a PDF file. So we're going to add a new postscript, uh, public access to records.
This is one of the required, no notices that must be included on APAD council agendas and for the content we'll just use.
We'll just paste in some recommended content we got from the city attorney's office. So create that agenda postscript, and here it is at the bottom and it will be included every time we create a agenda for a neighborhood council meeting.
And that's how you use the neighborhood council management system to add post-script for required notices for your neighborhood council meeting agendas.
Okay.
