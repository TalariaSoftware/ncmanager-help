When you take minutes at a neighborhood council meeting, those are draft minutes and should be clearly marked as such. The Neighborhood Council Management System
does that automatically putting "Draft minutes — not yet approved" right at the top of the minutes.

At a subsequent meeting, when the minutes are approved, they become the official record of that meeting and they should be marked approved along with the date.

To do that go here to the minutes page, click the little edit icon next to draft, and you can pick a date — what day the minutes were approved on. In this case, we're going to say, August 2nd and hit save.

I can see the minutes were approved on August 2nd. And now we know that they're the official minutes of that meeting.

And that's how we record minutes approvals using the Neighborhood Council Management System.
