When you take minutes at a neighborhood council meeting, those are draft minutes and it should be clearly marked as such the neighborhood council management system.
Does that automatically putting draft minutes, not yet approved right at the top of the minutes at a subsequent meeting, though, when the minutes are approved, they become the official record of that meeting and they should be marked approved along with the date to do that.
You go here to the minutes page, click the little edit icon next to draft, and you can pick a date what day the minutes were approved on in this case, we're going to, they were going to say, August hit save.
Okay. And I can see the minutes were approved on August 2nd. And now we know that they're the official minutes of that meeting.
And that's how we record minutes approvals using the neighborhood council management system.
