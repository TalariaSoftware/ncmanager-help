In order for some actions of the neighborhood council to take effect, you need
to submit a board action certification form. The Office of the City Clerk
requires these for all funding actions.

If you take minutes using the Neighborhood Council Management System, it will
automatically fill these forms out for you. All you have to do is download and
sign them.

Let's see how that works. Here we are on the minutes page for the July 5th, Lake
Woebegone board regular meeting. And did see that there is one item that was
passed? 

So we go over to the "Board Action Certification" and we can either click
download, which downloads the file directly to your computer, or view, and you
can see it right here in your browser, completely filled out. All it needs now
are the signatures.

And that's how you use the Neighborhood Council Management System to fill out
the board action certification forms.
