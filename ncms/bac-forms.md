In order for some actions of the neighborhood council to take effect, you need to submit a board action certification form.
The office of the city clerk requires these for all funding actions. Now, if you take minutes using the neighborhood council management system, it will automatically fill these forms out for you.
And all you have to do is download and sign them. Let's see how that works. Here. We are on the minutes page for the July 5th, like we'll be gone board, regular meeting.
And did you see there's one item that was passed? And so we go over to the board ACLS certification and we can either click download, which downloads the file directly to your computer, or if you, and you can see, see it right here in your browser, completely filled out.
All it needs. Now are the signatures. And that's how you use the neighborhood council management system to fill out the board certification forms.
