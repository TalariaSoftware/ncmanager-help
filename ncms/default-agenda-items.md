When creating a neighborhood council agenda, there are certain items that should always be included in order to make that easy.
When using NCMS, you can add those as default agenda items, and then every time you create a meeting, those items will automatically be added to the agenda.
Let's see how to do that. So here we are at the party committee, the mayor will be gone party committee page, and we can scroll down to default agenda items and add a default agenda item.
So this one's going to be called to order cause that's the thing that happens at every on every agenda should be the first item on the agenda.
A description that doesn't need a description called an order is pretty self-explanatory anticipated motion. We don't anticipate a motion coming out of this agenda item.
So we'll leave that blank. Also, there we go. Create default agenda item and there it is heading is call to order no description or license plate motion.
If there's more than one, you can use these buttons here to reorder them. So the different default agenda items appear in a different order, or we can go back and edit it.
If we decide we want to use sentence case craps instead of title case. So that's changed. And now when we create a new meeting, let's create a meeting for, Uh, July 3rd created meeting.
And we can see that it already has that new agenda item call to order because that's our, one of our default agenda items.
And that's how we create default agenda items using NCMS.
