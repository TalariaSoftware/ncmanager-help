So when taking neighborhood council minutes, the most important thing to include in the minutes is what the board or committee actually did.
The bunk policy actually requires recording every item, taking up for consideration at the meeting. So let's talk about how to do that with MTMs.
Uh, it's taken an audit, but for said, consideration, someone needs to make a motion. So that's what we do. We use the main motion button to record that.
And that brings up a forum where we can put in the agenda item, the texts, the motion who moved it, and also what time it was moved at now, agenda item and texts, the motion.
This is kind of a pain to type. They, they can be long, complicated, and sometimes things go fast, especially things that are routine like minutes approvals or murders approvals.
So for those, if you put them in the agenda as anticipated motions, we can go to our anticipated motions and automatically choose which one of these motions that we thought was gonna happen was that was actually made in this case.
We'll choose funding for NCMS. So we'll create that motion, uh, agenda item eight approved funding up to $10,000 for use of neighborhood council management system.
Uh, and we can, you know, put edited if we want and it will use maybe, maybe that was the actual motion that was made.
And we say, who, who made the motion? Um, I dunno where she was top of the list and then we create the main motion.
And now we have a motion on the floor that the board or committee is considering, and we can go on from there.
And that's how we record a main motion being made or an item being taken up at a neighborhood council meeting.
