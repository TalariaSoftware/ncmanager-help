Within the neighborhood council management system, there are specific features for all of the items that are required to be in the neighborhood council minutes, but sometimes you need to add something else.
The minutes, this can happen. If the assembly of the board committee orders it to be included in the minutes, or if it needs to be part of the neighborhood councils official records.
So for those things, we use the other action feature. That's this button right here, other action. And then we can put in what that item is.
Uh, for example, Michael real man, Uh, resigned as architect And that happened at 1207. So it create the meeting action.
And there it is, it shows up in the minutes, right there at 1207, Michael Ruhlman resigned his architect. And of course, like everything else and NCMS, you can edit it with a little edit button and he actually resigned a while ago.
This is when he announced his resignation. So there we go. I'll pay the meeting action. Okay. And now it's there in the minutes.
So this is good for anytime you need to add something that isn't specifically accounted for by the neighborhood council management system.
