When taking minutes at a neighborhood council meeting, it's important to record the results of the roll call. This way there is an official record of what members of your board or committee were present at the meeting.

To record the roll call using NCMS, use the "Take roll" button. This opens up the roll call page where you can mark each member is either present or absent. It also shows a total of how many members are present and how many are absent.

If you make a mistake, you can always undo it and then make the correction.

Once you're done, you can go back to the minutes and see that the roll call shows up in the minutes. "[5:10 pm] The roll is called." Five members present, one absent.

And that's how you take roll using NCMS.
