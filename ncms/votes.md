Once you have recorded the motion, like everything else in the Neighborhood
Council Management System, it is editable. We can use this little edit icon
here, and say no, she didn't actually say annual or maybe we change the agenda
item, or maybe, maybe it was actually somebody else that moved. It doesn't
matter. We can update the main motion like that.

Eventually you'll get to the point where it's time to vote on the motion.

That's what this table is here for, to record the votes. You can say Tahnee said
yes. Chidi abstained. (He couldn't make up his mind.) Janet said yes. Eleanor is
absent; we'll mark her absent.

Some motions tend to go really fast. If everybody just agrees, they all say
"yea, let's move on." You can record those quickly with the remaining members
buttons.  Just like that we have four yeses, zero nos, one abstention, one
absent, and we can record that the motion passed.

Now we have a completed main motion with the votes. We go back to the minutes
and we can see they're recorded in the minutes.
