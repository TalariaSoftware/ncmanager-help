Now, once you have recorded the motion, like everything else in the neighborhood council management system, it is editable. So we can use this little edit icon here, say, no, she didn't actually say annual, or maybe we change the agenda item, or maybe, maybe it was extra.
Somebody else that moves it doesn't matter. We can update the main motion like that. And eventually you'll get to the point where it's time to vote on the motion.
And that's what this table is here for here to record the votes. So you can say Tahnee said, yes, Chidi abstained.
He couldn't make up his mind. Janet said, yes. Uh, Eleanor is absent. Well, Mark, her absent. Uh, and for some motions, they tend to go really fast.
You know, if everybody just agrees, they all say gay we'll move on. Uh, and so you can record those quickly with a remaining members.
Yes. And just like that, we have four yeses, zero nos, one abstention, one absent, and we can record that the motion failed.
And now we have a completed main motion with the votes and we go back to the minutes and we can see it they're recorded in the minutes.
